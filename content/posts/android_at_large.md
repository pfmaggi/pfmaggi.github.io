With Android making its way to new form factors, and OEM’s pushing the boundaries with new technology, it’s time to take a look at what these environments bring to you and your users. It’s crucial that your developer workflow accounts for resizability, new display sizes and aspect ratios, multi display, and app continuity to provide your users the best experience no matter where they are. The days of taking the easy road with screenOrientation=""portrait"" are quickly coming to an end.

In this talk, we discuss the challenges faced when looking to support Android on various platforms, and how to make sure that you’re providing a great experience on all of these form-factors. You will leave this talk with an actionable checklist that helps stabilize your app and user experience on any device.

Presented by: Kenneth Ford, Pietro Maggi
