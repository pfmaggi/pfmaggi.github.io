Hi!  
My name is Pietro F. Maggi.  
I'm a father an husband and occasionally I find the time to write some code.

I really believe that the best way to learn how something works is to take it apart (I know, I can't really blame my kids when they do the same).

I've more than fifteen years designing and developing software solutions with a deep mobile experience. I sometimes speak at conferences about the Android developer tools and libraries.

Public speaking, business development, and software development are my main strengths.
