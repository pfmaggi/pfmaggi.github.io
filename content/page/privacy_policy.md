# Privacy

Privacy matters but it can be confusing. This page explains our approach to privacy on all our websites and how it affects you.

## Short version

We do not collect any statistics about your visit.

## Measuring our visitors

In the past we were measuring visitors to our website using Google Analytics. 

Given that we were not using those information anyway, we decided to switch them off.

You can learn more about [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) or [opt out if you wish](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Updates to this policy

We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time, particularly as technology changes. You can always check this page for the latest version.

## For additional questions

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, please write to us by email to [support@pietromaggi.com](mailto:support@pietromaggi.com).
