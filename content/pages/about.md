I'm a father an husband and occasionally I find the time to write some code.

I really believe that the best way to learn how something works is to take it apart (I know, I can't really blame my kids when they do the same).

I've more than fifteen years designing and developing software solutions with a deep mobile experience. I sometimes speak at conferences about the Android developer tools and libraries.

Public speaking, business development, and software development are my main strengths.

## Specialties:

- Developer Relations.
- Designing and implementation of Mobile solutions and Mobile Web solutions.
- Software development from bare metal embedded to backend servers.
- RF and 802.11 technology.
- Mentoring and coaching resources.
- Managing partners and customers satisfaction.
- Communication skill.
- Fast Learner.

If I've to define myself in a sentence, I'm an *Extrovert Developer*
