Privacy matters but it can be confusing. This page explains our approach to privacy on all our websites and how it affects you.

## Short version

I do not collect any statistics about your visit. As this blog is currently hosted on Github's Pages, some of your informations are going to be recorded on their servers but, as far as I know, I've to access to those information.

## Updates to this policy

We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time, particularly as technology changes. You can always check this page for the latest version.

## For additional questions

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, please write to us by email to [support@pietromaggi.com](mailto:support@pietromaggi.com).
